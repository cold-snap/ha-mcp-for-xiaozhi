### Debugging Instructions

 1.The tools exposed depend on the type of entity you expose to the HomeAssistant voice assistant
   
 2.Try to use the latest version of HomeAssistant. There are obvious differences in the tools provided by the May version and the March version.

 3.If debugging doesn't work as expected, first check Xiaozhi's chat log to see how he handles the command and whether he has a tool that calls HomeAssist. Currently, a major known issue is that lighting and music control can conflict with the built-in screen and music control logic. This will be resolved after the XiaGe server supports built-in tool selection next month.
 
 4.If the process correctly calls the built-in function of HA, you can open the debug log of this plug-in to observe the actual execution status.
